    This is something I kind of struggle to suggest to anyone, but it pays to be good at politics.
    It not only pays you, but it also pays people you respect and adore.
    Don't get me wrong though, I hate politics.
</p>

    <h3>I. Hate. Politics.</h3>

<p>
    Truly, I hope that someday we, as a species, can get to a point where we can be an objective meritocracy.
</p>

    <h3>Not playing means you lose</h3>

<p>
    The problem with not playing the game is that it allows people who are not genuine to advance
    ahead of those which are working with an altruistic lens of the world.
    It helps your altruistic cause to be utilitarian and realistic too.
    It would be FANTASTIC if those which worked harder and smarter were equivalently awarded,
    however it is often the case that the hard workers are taken advantage of by people who were lucky and played the game.
</p>

<p>
    The nice thing about politics is that is does not need to be underhanded or dishonest.
</p>

<h3>Politics can be used for good!</h3>

<p>
    If you start publicly defending or pointing out the successes of people you also find to be hard working and honest people, 
    you'll start to notice that they're more likely to internalize that and do the same.
</p>

<p>
    A more tricky problem is when other people take ideas or work, and misrepresent it as their own. 
    It is an especially awkward situation when that idea or work is your own and you told this person in confidence.
    It's hard to combat this without appearing self-serving to the rest of the crowd.
    One way is to play the long game and watch like a hawk for when it happens to someone else, 
    particularly when you already know that someone is liable to be a credit hoarder. 
    If you hear or see them take credit for someone else's result, speak up publicly about it and 
    make sure that the victim knows they're being vouched for. 
    It will make them happy, I promise.
</p>

<p>
    If you are someone with rapport, and someone without reputation has a great idea: present it publicly for them!
    While you're presenting, it is quite easy to come out and say "Jayne is the one who brought this to light, 
    so I'd like to thank her for that and hope that she'll help move it forward."
    And what a powerful tool that is for BOTH of you. Not only does she gain credit and reputation, 
    you gain trust and people are more likely to approach you in the future. 
    It doesn't pay to alienate anyone against you.
</p>

<h3>People get bitter</h3>

<p>
    People will start to resent you if you sabotage their efforts.
    They will feel this way if you steal their ideas, if you discredit them to other people, 
    or even if you thwart any tactics they might pull that seem underhanded to you. 
    They'll start to undermine your efforts if they feel as if you're an obstacle.
</p>

<p>
    It's important to remember that when working with people that you find are underhandedly political, they can thwart your efforts.
    If you piss someone off enough, you will sacrifice the political capital that enables you to be an effective agent of change.
    Keep that in mind when making your moves. I suggest that you wear a white glove when trying to root out bad politics.
</p>

<p>
    As long as you aren't combative, and stick to positive and public reinforcement, the political capital should not be an issue.
</p>

<h3>Improve your culture</h3>

<p>
    These types of effort might engender a grassroots positive politics movement if you stick with it.
    It would root out those who seek only to climb the corporate ladder.
    It could fix your culture one act at a time, and you might be surprised at how quickly it snowballs.
</p>

<p>
    You might even change those climbers to lifters once they realize it's not helpful to their cause to step on other people's backs.
