<p>
    In C#, if you had three classes Grandma, Mom, and Daughter.
    Every Grandma is a Mom, every Mom is a Daughter.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-C#">    
class Grandma : Mom
{
}         
class Mom : Daughter
{
}         
class Daughter
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Constructors run in this order: Daughter > Mom > Grandma
</p>

<p>
    Initializers run in this order: Grandma > Mom > Daughter
</p>

<p>
    So when you are calling a virtual method, for example, in Daughter's constructor, 
    you are calling something which will not have Mom's or Grandma's types constructed yet.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-C#">    
class Daughter
{
    public Daughter()
    {
        DoHobby();
    }
    protected virtual void DoHobby()
    {
    }
}
class Mom : Daughter
{
}
class Grandma : Mom
{
    private string foo;
    public Grandma() { foo = "KNITTING"; }
    protected override void DoHobby()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(foo.ToLower());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this example, when you get a `new Grandma()`, 
    you also get a `NullReferenceException` when you might have expected a new wool sweater.
</p>

<p>
    While this specific problem is fairly unique to C#, it's a good reminder to follow the Liskov Substitution Principle.
</p>

<p>
    This principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote and later published in a paper. The original definition:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Which ultimately simplifies to Uncle Bob's definition:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
</blockquote>

<p>
    From which you can infer that child types should not blow up the parent.
    By calling a method which is intended to be overridden in children BEFORE those children are constructed,
    we are opening ourselves up to violating that principle.
</p>

<p>
    The most common situation I see this, is in Entity Framework entities, 
    particularly for instantiating collections so as to avoid any null references.
    While this probably won't be harmful, another way is to use property initializers.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-C#"> 
/// <summary> The "wrong" way </summary>
class Mom : Daughter
{
    public Mom()
    {
        Children = new List<Child>();
    }
    public virtual List<Child> Children { get; set; }
}


/// <summary> The "right" way </summary>
class Mom : Daughter
{
    public virtual List<Child> Children { get; set; } = new List<Child>();
}
</code></pre>
