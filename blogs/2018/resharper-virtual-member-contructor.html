<p>
    In C#, if you had three classes Grandma, Mom, and Daughter.
    Every Grandma is a Mom, every Mom is a Daughter.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-C#">    
class Grandma : Mom
{
}         
class Mom : Daughter
{
}         
class Daughter
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Constructors run in this order: Daughter > Mom > Grandma
</p>

<p>
    Initializers run in this order: Grandma > Mom > Daughter
</p>

<p>
    So when you are calling a virtual method, for example, in Daughter's constructor, 
    you are calling something which will not have Mom's or Grandma's types constructed yet.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-C#">    
class Daughter
{
    public Daughter()
    {
        DoHobby();
    }
    protected virtual void DoHobby() 
    {
    }
}

class Mom : Daughter
{
}

class Grandma : Mom
{
    private string foo;
    public Child() { foo = "KNITTING"; }
    protected override void DoHobby()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(foo.ToLower());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this example, when you get a `new Grandma()`, 
    you also get a `NullReferenceException` when you might have expected a new wool sweater.
</p>

<p>
    While this specific problem is fairly unique to C#, it's a good reminder to follow the Liskov Substitution Principle.
</p>

<p>
    This principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote and later published in a paper. The original definition:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Which ultimately simplifies to Uncle Bob's definition:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
</blockquote>

<p>
    From which you can infer that child types should not blow up the parent.
    By calling a method which is intended to be overridden in children BEFORE those children are constructed,
    we are opening ourselves up to violating that principle.
