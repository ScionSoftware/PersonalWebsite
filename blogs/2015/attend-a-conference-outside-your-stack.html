    I recently attended Qcon. 
    This particular conference was hosted in New York City by InfoQ, 
    a very popular and generally agnostic software content source.
</p>

<p>
    You can now view all of the topics and most of the talks on their site 
    <a href="http://www.infoq.com/conferences/qconnewyork2015" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    If you're not interested in doing the leg work for that, 
    I can summarize the conference as being very open source, architecture and soft skills heavy with a huge focus on java and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
    Another conference I have attended outside of my stack was MongoNYC back in 2012. 
    This conference, as it sounds, was basically a giant informational marketing 
    session for MongoDb and vendors that were able to finagle their way in. 
    They really were great sessions though.

    I am primarily and professionally a Microsoft stack developer. 
    As such, it can be very easy to get comfy in the spoon fed world of dot NET. 
    It is increasingly important as your career goes on to get out of your knowledge and social comfort zones.
    You can do this without attending conferences and meetups of course but there is an experience 
    in talking to others who are practiced in these stacks that can't quite be matched.

<h4>I can summarize some of my most invaluable learnings or reinforcements or hypotheses succinctly.
</h4>
<ul class="styled">
    <li>There is an incredibly wide and vibrant set of technology stacks out there.
    </li>

    <li>Most other well established stacks have very different ways of doing things that can be valuable to understand.
    </li>

    <li>There is a lot of shame associated with being a dot NET developer in these communities.
    </li>

    <li>Agnostic and conferences are a lot less focused on trying to sell you something and are instead focused on providing you incredible intellectual value.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I know this was a short one, but definitely give it a try if you get the opportunity.
