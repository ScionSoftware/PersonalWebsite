<p>
    I have to say that I am impressed with the agile industry. 
</p>


<p>
    They make a ton of money off of organizations that believe that they 
    have everything else totally figured out, except for process! 
</p>

<p>
    These organizations have development teams who have really been 
    struggling to deliver what they need when they need it. 
    It's quite strange really because everything was going 
    swimmingly when they started out, while now they are swimming 
    through syrup.
</p>

<p>
    So some managers and developers have heard and understood that 
    agile is just the way to do things now, and that the organizations 
    that aren't agile just die off.
</p>

<p>
    "Oh, agile, that's SCRUM right?"
</p>

<p>
    So we talk to some people, and read up on SCRUM. 
    We introduce these things called sprints. 
    Perhaps we hire some certified scrummasters, 
    and have agile training and workshops. 
    We split our teams according to the two pizza rule. 
    We start a backlog and have people dedicated to grooming it.
</p>

<p>
    The developers help setup and coordinate stories and tasks during planning, 
    and update everyone on progress during stand up meetings. 
    Meetings are short and developers are coding, 
</p>

<p>
    We are feeling really fresh and good now. 
    We can actually see what is going on now. 
</p>

<p>
    It seems like we are making tons of progress 
    in these first months we have “gone agile”.
</p>

<p>
    But slowly… very slowly… that same uncomfortable feeling sets in that was there before we went agile. 
    We have this insurmountable workload, 
    and it doesn’t seem like we’re getting through it any faster than before. 
    How can this be? We have wildly varying velocity, 
    and we can never quite seem to get done what we commit to as a department. 
    What we commit to doesn’t even seem to be satisfying to the product team and other stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
    We start to realize that this SCRUM thing didn’t actually fix anything. 
    Our development process and throughput is just as bad as before. 
    What happened? Wasn’t this supposed to fix our output woes?
</p>

<p>
    No, SCRUM, or any of the other agile methodologies will not 
    just magically fix your throughput problems after you adopt 
    every facet of them religiously. 
    These methodologies will just show you how badly 
    your development practices suck.
</p>

<p>
    Most organizations don’t adopt agile until they are already 
    suffering from serious technical problems, 
    which lead to a serious lack of ability to deliver business needs.
</p>

<p>
    Usually, by the time your organization has gone agile, 
    your code base is reeling so badly from the poor decisions 
    and cut corners over the years that it is going to be slow going, 
    regardless of the process you choose to put around it. 
    This is something the business conveniently likes to ignore, 
    but it’s something that needs to be put at the forefront of discussion. 
    Agile methods have shown us we’re going slow, 
    then it’s up to us to figure out why we’re moving slow, and fix it.
</p>

<p>
    Agile process alone won’t fix your development problems, 
    you need technical excellence for successful projects. 
    The two are necessary for a continually successful organization. 
</p>

<p>
    Technical debt makes a system more fragile and difficult to change. 
    The more there is, the exponentially worse it gets. 
    It’s not time for the business to understand that technical 
    excellence is a necessary ingredient for the business, 
    it’s time for developers to stop playing the victims and do their jobs well. 
</p>

<p>
    I have heard the same sob story over and over again. 
    It sounds something like this: 
    “I would love to write tests and clean everything up, 
    but they just won’t give me any time for it”. 
    Truthfully, you should have done it well in the first place 
    and it isn’t their business to keep giving you dedicated 
    time after the fact to fix the things you’ve screwed up. 
    If you have a lot of technical debt, that sucks, 
    but a safe and reliable way to bring it under control 
    is to follow the boy scout rule. 
    Greenfield development will always be easy and wonderful, and
    it is what your team can do in brownfield that is truly telling of your abilities.
    Take the extra few minutes to clean up code 
    while you’re working on tasks or stories. 
</p>

<p>
    As a professional developer, 
    the business expectation of you is that you will deliver features and changes, 
    and you will do so with high quality. 
    So why keep blaming the business and other 
    developers for your lack of technical excellence?
</p>

<p>
    Because of our failings, 
    the agile industry has effectively sold a half solution to many businesses. 
    Most agile consultants are life coaches who haven’t really lived the life, 
    so they leave technical excellence as an emphasis to the wayside. 
    Even those who push for things like XP, including pair programming and TDD, 
    are often discredited by developers as not being able to walk the walk.
</p>

<p>
    Now we have a bunch of people arguing that some agile methodologies 
    are lame ducks or snake oil. We have businesses using half of a 
    recipe for successful projects, and then calling it a failure of a recipe. 
    Cookies aren’t going to come out well if you leave out the eggs or the flour.
</p>

<p>
    If in your development department, 
    you establish a culture of learning and quality, 
    you might find that a lot of these problems will slowly fix themselves. 
    Put an emphasis on craftsmanship, and see your teams flourish. 
</p>

<p>
    If you need more developers, 
    don’t just find warm bodies, 
    take your time and make sure to find those developers that 
    will encourage the culture and quality you need. 
    If you bring passionate people in, and make that the focus, 
    you might find that the rest of your teams start to really care about what they do.
</p>

<p>
    We should stop blaming the business for our failings. 
    If an organization is willing to fully adopt new processes to help us deliver, 
    they are not the ones being inflexible. 
    We put a lot of internal pressure on ourselves to get features out 
    the door as fast as possible, 
    not even thinking about the fact that when it slows us down later, 
    that costs the business money too. 
    Doing things well in the first place, 
    or at least incrementally repairing the holes in 
    our ship is how we can keep our project going.  
    Take some ownership over your bad code, stop playing the victim.
