    The official AngularJS blog has posted an article about their adventures and methods in 
        <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2015/08/angular-1-and-angular-2-coexistence.html" target="_blank">supporting incremental upgrades from 1.x to 2.x
        </a>
</p>

<h4>The Great Migration</h4>

<p>
    The gist of this is you can take most of your Angular 1.x code, and consume it side by side with your Angular 2.x code.
    We will be able to mark specific items and upgrade them piece by piece instead of view by view as was the last iteration.
</p>

<p>
    The Angular team has been consistently hinting that if you follow best practices, the migration will be much easier.
    The more modularized and component driven your application is, the less you'll have to worry. 
    This is just a lesson in RTFM and clean code in general.
</p>

<h4>Technology Adoption Problems</h4>

<p>
    This is a long way from the initial fears of <i>NO UPGRADE PATH</i>. 
    What really happened is that the Angular team announced the major overhaul 
    and said that there <i>isn't yet a migration path</i>. 
    People took this as gloom and doom and it was widely taken 
    to mean there would be no upgrade path.
    Naysayers pointed their fingers and deemed it the wrong choice.
    Users and teams fretted over gambling on a framework and wasting 
    their time pouring effort into the Angular way to do things.
</p>

<h4>Publicity Problems</h4>

<p>
    Really the Angular team had few choices here. 
    They wanted to push their framework forward and had reached some limitations with how it was architected.
    They opted to rehaul everything and could have announced it like they did or done it in secrecy.
    If they had done it in secret, they wouldn't have gotten nearly as much feedback as they have.
    If they didn't get the feedback, they might not have fleshed things out this far.
</p>

<p>
    So really their choice amounted to: Announce the changes; take the angry mobs rabbles; incrementally make it easier to migrate
</p>

<p>
    This is how an open source project is supposed to be done. 
    It is community driven. 
    It is pragmatic.
    You make changes as they are called for. 
    You don't try to future proof.
</p>

<h4>Even if you don't migrate, Angular 1.X is still awesome</h4>

<p>
    Hating on AngularJS is popular to do these days, but I still use it and I still love it.
    It has served me very well in both keeping things clean and getting shit done fast.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a group of people educated on clean javascript and idiomatic AngularJS: 
    you can have a beatiful, functional, sleek and standardized front end code base.
    You can have reusable components which are inherently testable. That is awesome.
</p>

<h4>AngularJS 1.0 is dead, long live AngularJS 2.0</h4>

<p>
    Angular was revolutionary in my opinion. 
    I expect that this news will solidify NG in the toolsets of many a developer.
    I might even go back to using Angular for my blog for the server side support.
