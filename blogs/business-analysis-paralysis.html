<h2>Business Push Back</h2>

I talk to a lot of people who think up, use, or develop corporate/business niche applications.

I am one of those people.

Part of what we do, part of what we get paid to do, is to think. We get paid to learn the business model. We get paid to learn how to save money. Make processes better. Make lives easier.

We learn by using, by reading, by applying our outside the box knowledge in new and creative ways. As they say in technology, if you’re not moving, you’re dying.

When you have people in your organization who care. When you have people who want to perform, who want to shine, who want to fix things. Get the hell out of their way. If you are in a leadership position, and you have competent people, let them shine. Offer your business expertise, ask if they need anything from you, and get the hell out of the way.

<b>Hear me out here...</b>

Yes, you have been in the business for a while now. You know a lot, but you are stretched so thin! You have to manage so many expectations at once, how can you hope to properly analyze and prioritize grass root efforts to build up an awesome money maker in some subset of your giant corporation?

People learning lasting lessons involve stumbling and kicking tires. Trust your professionals, and that respect and rapport you establish will far outweigh any mini-micro-management you do today.

One of my biggest gripes in business life, particularly when it stops me from doing my job, is analysis paralysis. PUSH BACK!!!!

<h2>Analysis Paralysis</h2>

When you decide something is good to do, and research it and start the process, but the business side decides they should research where is best to put their money. Then you stop progress on the current task and research another task. Repeat cycle.

You hired me to clean rooms. You’re paying me to stumble into a large dark room, eventually find a light switch, and by the time I turn the lights on and start cleaning, you decide that we should focus on a larger room elsewhere, because it will be a better investment of time. This happens all the time.

You paid us to find a light switch, and then do nothing with the room. By the time we get back around to that room, it will have been against electrical code, and the light switch will have been moved.

Let the work that is started go through. You’ll waste a lot less money. Listen to the people who are fervently trying to get better at what they do, and in turn make you more money.
