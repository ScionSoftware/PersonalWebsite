<h3>Day to Day in Object Oriented Programming</h3>

<p>Jargon sucks sometimes, and it’s just another barrier to entry. 
    This is the beginning of a series of short and sweet definitions in programming.</p>

<p>I figured, seeing as it is something I have battled as a young developer 
    coming out of a curriculum weak in theory, that I would put together a 
    list of relevant and often used terms and acronyms.</p>

<p>I hope this can help some new folk up to speed.</p>

<h2>Jimmy</h2>
<p>A newb developer. Also can refer to one’s “cool”. 
    Don’t get your jimmies rustled. 
    Jimmy is over there rustling some code again, someone help him out.</p>

<h2>Collection</h2>
<p>A collection is just an organization of like objects. 
    Say you have an object of type ‘Jimmy’. You can declare a collection of type Jimmy[], 
    which is a Jimmy array. You can only put objects of type Jimmy in the array.</p>

<h2>Node</h2>
<p>For most intents and purposes, node means item. 
    A node is an item in a collection.</p

<h2>Enumerate or enumeration</h2>
<p>This means to move through a collection of objects one by one. (node by node)</p>

<h2>Hash</h2>
<p>When you hash an object, you take all of it’s properties, 
    and use a hashing algorithm to get a key unique to objects with those values. 
    This is often useful in creating dictionaries or hash maps, another type of collection.</p>

<h2>Class</h2>
<p>A class is simply an organization of code. 
    Classes can contain properties and methods.</p>

<h2>Property</h2>
<p>A property is simply an attribute of a type on an object. 
    Examples of types are int, string, decimal, Person, object, string.</p

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>A method is basically a named chunk of code. 
    It is a consolidated way to perform some logic. 
    Methods can accept parameters to assist in performing logic, 
    and methods can return values. Methods are simply functions 
    within classes. Most object oriented languages do not allow 
    function definitions outside of classes or structs.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>
    These can be considered contracts. An interface specifies methods and return types. A return type is another kind of contract. It tells the user that they can definitely expect that type of object from the method.
    A class that implements an interface must instantiate every method defined in the interface.
    Interfaces are awesome because they allow us to abstract away the implementation of some logic 
    from the users of our application. We give them an interface, 
    and they can use that interface while we swap out any fixes or changes or tests we want on our side.
</p>

<h2>Obfuscation</h2>
<p>This is when you don’t really want something to be understood. 
    You make something very complex, or difficult to understand.</p>

<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
<p>To encapsulate is to enclose logic away from users of an object. 
    You define the interfaces you want to be used, and you hide away the logic via private calls to whatever you want. 
    Encapsulation is a very very important aspect of clean programming.</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>A process or set of rules to be followed. 
    Often used when talking about code to process a collection of objects.</p>

<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>Basically, making things more human understandable (hopefully). 
    You typically want to hide the details in your implementations.</p>
<h2>Query</h2>
<p>This is what it sounds like. 
    You ask a data source, or API a question, and you receive the data.</p>
<h2>Serialization</h2>
<p>This is an oft used term that boils down to, turn an object into binary. 
    This could be for transport or storage.

    </a></p>
<h2>Parse or parsing</h2>
<p>Read text or strings and process them into useful data structures 
    (e.g., an object of one of the classes you have defined).</p>
<h2>API (Application Programming Interface)</h2>
<p>This is basically a specification of how programs interact with each other. 
    It is a set of outward facing methods that obscure a lot of inner workings. 
    This is generically and generally, a facade pattern.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about any of my definitions, or have any corrections, let me know and I’ll gladly assist. I’ll try to release general definitions of jargon on a regular basis, and maybe run through some of the code I have been writing lately.</p>
