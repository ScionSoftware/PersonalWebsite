<h5>Dec 7, 2012</h5>

<p>
    So, I haven't written a blog post in a while. There has been a lot of change in life, fast.
</p>
To cover the main changes:
<ul>
    <li>I am engaged to my lovely lady, we're due to be married in autumn next year.</li>
    <li>I am now a home owner, it's a nice brick duplex, I am looking for tenants.</li>
    <li>I have changed jobs, moving from VB.NET to C# and will get to explore a few new technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I hear they say that good things come in threes, and I'm glad the third was a job and not a kid. Not quite prepared for that one yet.
</p>

<p>
    Things are moving pretty swimmingly, and I think I've followed my own preachings fairly well. See <a href="http://spykebytes.me/too-little-butter-too-much-bread">Too Much Bread</a>.  I am satisfied enough with my life balance to visit my professional development pretty seriously again. Plus, I am in the honeymoon phase of my new job, so I've totally got to kick it up a notch. Expect some blog posts related to Microsoft MVC, entity framework, JavaScript, dapper, client-side MVC, ad marketing, and general discovery.
</p>
<p>
    I just wanted to wish everyone happy holidays and good luck. I'm going to set some goals for this next year, just as I did last year. I think you should too. Both short term and long term goals will clear your vision and give you something to actually strive for.
</p>
<h3>3 Months:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Become kick ass at my job</li>
    <li>Finish out the first version of my chess application</li>
    <li>Make people happy</li>
</ul>
<h3>6 Months:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Be back down to a buff 165 pounds (running and swimming shape)</li>
    <li>Become really kick ass at my job</li>
    <li>Make people happy</li>
    <li>Own a decent car</li>
</ul>
<h3>12 Months:</h3>

</ul>

<p>
    I'll update with dates and whatnot. Good luck and life everyone.
