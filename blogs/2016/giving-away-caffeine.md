An interesting thing happened today. (Saturday: 2016-01-23) 

I am on my way home from a company meeting in Bangkok. I've been feeling friendly and generally cheerful as of late.

My flight left Bangkok at 1:40 AM local time, and we arrived in Doha at approximately 5:00 AM local time. 
As you can imagine there is no shortage of tired people. I went to get some caffeine and came back with a few extra cappuccinos and mochaccinos. 

As I was offering them up to people one by one, everyone was turning me down. 
I shrugged it off and just kept moving to the next person: smiling and offering their choice of drink.
The earlier people I had asked took an interest in this. One approached me and said, "You know what I would love a cappuccino". 
I smiled and pointed it out and thanked her for taking one. 
After seeing this, another one of the first people I asked said he would also like a mochaccino. 
I eventually gave another one away and sat down to enjoy my own and a couple cookies.

This was a pretty good experience overall. 
Even though I was turned down many times, it was fun to watch them smile after I offered some caffeine. 
I imagine they were surprised and a bit confused because this stuff doesn't typically happen. 
It was fairly magical to have people who had said no, watch me try to force caffeine on a bunch of strangers, and change their mind. 
I don't know whether it was because they decided they actually wanted the drink and believed that I hadn't poisoned it, or if they just wanted to make me feel good about my efforts. 

I would imagine it is some combination of the two. 
I was listening to an audio version of "Rules to Break and Laws to Follow", which posited that if people were purely rational, they wouldn't trust anyone with anything. 
They went on to say that it is a good thing that we aren't rational because it leads to a more social and positive world. 
We feel a need to punish those who are acting in an unjust way, and reward those who are acting in a charitable or giving fashion.

This was all on a whim, but I like to think that I spent $30 in order to make other people feel good and want to pay it forward. 
Even if they didn't accept my offer, that might have opened up their hearts and minds a bit. 

I recognize that we can't all be revolutionaries and timeless artists and billionaire philanthropists. 
Imagine if we really did crowd source this good deeds thing, how much better the world would be. 

NOTE: I recognize that this post sounds a bit self righteous, but I don't really care, I think it's a good message.
