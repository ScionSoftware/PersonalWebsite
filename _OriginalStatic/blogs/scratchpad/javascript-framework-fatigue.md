There are lots of articles complaining about JavaScript frameworks, but this one is mine.

We all have our own sense of what is ideal and pragmatic. 
It could be that picking the perfect framework is what you find best.
It could be that sticking with a common denominator is what you find most responsible.

Personally I have been tending toward the common denominator position. There is no denying the satisfaction of finding the right tool for the right job, but I shy away from this mentality when it becomes confrontational or even dogmatic.

It seems as though there is always someone peddling the new amazing JavaScript library. 

 * This one is better because it's super fast!
 * This one is better because mega-company backs it!
 * This one is better because it's opinionated!
 * This one is better because it's not opinionated!
 * This one is better because it uses npm!
 * This one is better because it doesn't use npm!
 * This one is better because TypeScript!
 * This one is better because not TypeScript!

Okay, I'll stop now.

What I am trying to drive home there is that I feel most of the comments on implementation decisions are superfluous. Someone we respect says something half-baked about how they don't like something and suddenly it's uncool. It cascades out and becomes truth because we keep saying it.

We all want to be *right* about the technologies we have invested our time in. I lucked out with Angular, as I had a forward-looking hipster manager who made me a guinea pig a while back.

I've been happy with it because I haven't yet encountered a front-end that couldn't be elegantly (in my opinion) solved with Angular. Something else which is wonderful, it is an established technology and you can assume most people have experience or know enough to talk about it now. You know what that means? It means your project is inherently more available to the community. 

It means you're not strapped if the hipster leaves.

I feel like I'm consistently fed with how much better some other framework or library is, as if there aren't both pros and cons and as if they don't both solve the problem well enough. 

I mean to say, if it solves your problem and other people can get in there and understand and work with the solution, I'd call that success.

It's a strange battle that is always being fought, but I don't mean to sound like a complete curmudgeon about new technologies. I like to think I fall in line after the early adopters do, after there is some inertia. 

We need hipster programmers for their crazy love for crazy ideas and inventions and re-inventions. 

I'm just a bit tired of studying all these frameworks I'll never need, but I'll probably keep doing it anyways.
