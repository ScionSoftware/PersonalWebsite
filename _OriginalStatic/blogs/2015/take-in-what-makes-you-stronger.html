<p>
    Take in only that which makes you stronger.
</p>

<p>
    This is advice that is good for everyone.
</p>

<p>
    As it pertains to your abilities and career as a software engineer, however,
    there are certain things we can do or be aware of to ensure we are getting better as time passes.
</p>

<p>
    There is a difference between <i>deliberate</i> practice and going through the motions.
</p>
<p>
    This sounds obvious when stated, 
    but if you show up to work and do the same things the same way for ten years,
    you won't be able to compete with people who show up with the mindset to improve themselves.
    There are a lot of people that believe that simply because they put the time in,
    they should be respected and put on a pedestal.
</p>

<p>
    This isn't to say that experience over time is not valuable, in fact, it is invaluable!
    You can't put a price on seeing ten years of movement in this industry.
    We have a lack of truly senior people in our field. However, as I have mentioned earlier,
    showing up and putting CRUD screens together for ten years in a hardly-moving ecosystem
    can hardly qualify someone to be leading the next generation of developers.
</p>

<p>
    To the main point, stagnation will always be our greatest enemy in this field.
    There are luckily many ways to combat this.
</p>

<p>
    Seek people who are smarter than you, and latch onto them.
    At least find people as smart as you so you can develop your talents in tandem.
    Keep in mind, that because you're all human, you will have different opinions,
    and because you found people smarter than you, 
    their opinions might have merit that isn't immediately apparent to you.
    Shut up and listen to them. Hear them all the way through, 
    ask questions, and then try to pull out the parts you can really use.
</p>

<p>
    Actively seek feedback from your peers. Whether it's for technical critique, or interpersonal advice,
    someone who doesn't have your tunnel vision can have important insights for you to act on.
    We typically don't waltz up to people and solicit them with negative feedback,
    which is why it's so important that we actively seek it.
    You don't want to be stinky kid forever, if you ask sometime,
    they will likely tell you that you smell like hot ketchup.
    Don't be the stinky kid with no introspection.
</p>

<p>
    It is absolutely critical that we keep an open mind, meaning that we are open to criticism, in any form.
    Whether it's an architect telling you why you shouldn't bother adding in a hook for some future feature,
    or a junior developer asking you why you needed to make some methods generic, 
    there can be immense value in both if you are willing to pursue it.
</p>

<p>
    With that in mind, know that there is a lot of noise and some people like to speak just to be heard.
    Only take from conversation that which makes you stronger, 
    not that which someone told you is just the way to do things.
</p>

<p>
    On that note, if you want to write blogs, or branch out into different technologies?
    DO IT.
    I have had people tell me that I shouldn't be polluting the internet with my opinions,
    or that focusing my efforts outside of the technology stack I use in my day job is a waste of time.
    Screw them. That will not make you stronger.
</p>

<p>
    I know that this is a field where burnout and depression are very real threats.
    Never push yourself to those limits, and if you do? Yeah, take a break.
    Go take a walk in the woods, axe kick a copy machine, get some exercise.
    I find that I am always reinvigorated after bringing myself back to a good sleep and workout schedule.
    Throwing a conference in the mix puts the fire back in my belly too.
</p>

<p>
    Past being open to ideas from other people and networking, the rest is quite easy to overcome.
    There is no emotional barrier to scanning news feeds for emerging technologies.
    There is no pro fighter boxing you out from buying the books you've heard about.
    There is nothing stopping you from tinkering with that app you've been meaning to work on.
</p>

<p>
    You'll actually feel a lot better about yourself when you're being productive.
    You may also find that these things make you really good at your job.
    You may also find that being really good at your job not only wins reward from your employers,
    but also respect from your peers.
</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but that last part sounds really good to me.</p>
