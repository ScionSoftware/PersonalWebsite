    <h4>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering
        <sub>by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.</sub>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Fred Brooks points out that many of the challenges we face in building complex software
        are the same today as they were in the 1960s. Building things is as much about people and management
        as it is about technology. This is one of those timeless classics 
        that will be valuable for the lifetime of our industry. 
        Pick it up for posterity.
