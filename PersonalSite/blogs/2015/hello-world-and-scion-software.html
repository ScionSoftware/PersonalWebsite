<h2>
    Hello world!
</h2>

<p>
    This is the beginning of Scion Software as well as a fresh new look for my site.
</p>

<p>
    I have decided to combine my personal brand and my professional brand into one entity.
    I will be working out the kinks in this new design and adding some more 
    robust features in the coming months.
</p>

<p>
    I hope to establish this company as my brand and 
    as an example of software and web done right.
    This will be my shell company for working with 
    <a href="http://particular.net/" target="_blank">Particular Software</a>, 
    but in time I hope to establish Scion Software as a brand of excellence as well.
    You can view NServiceBus source code 
    <a href="https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus" target="_blank">here</a>, 
    which is Particular Software's flagship product. 
    I am very excited to be joining an organization that has taken 
    to solving the problems we face in distributed software.
</p>

<h3>
    Steady growth through excellence.
</h3>

<p>
    Steady growth through excellence will be the motto of Scion Software. 
    My goal will be to make everything and everyone I work with better off for it.
    I intend to grow into the craft of software development and 
    hope to deliver massive value for people along the way. 
</p>

<h3>Open source by default</h3>

<p>
    The nice part about software is that efforts can compound over time 
    to truly make the sum of the work be greater than it's parts. 
    This is why Scion Software will be open source by default. 
    There will obviously be client code bases which will not be open sourced,
    but the work done by Scion Software for any cross cutting concerns, 
    infrastructure, or generic work will be open and available to those who 
    would either like to use it, or even contribute.
</p>

<p>
    I have a bit of a mission to help the OSS community in .NET blossom.
    Microsoft has a wonderful framework for efficient development, 
    but we have lagged behind in the open source movement for far too long.
    With the advent of Microsoft embracing open source in initiatives such as 
    <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn" target="_blank">Roslyn</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx" target="_blank">.NET Core</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc" target="_blank">MVC</a>, 
    it is time that we start doing this by default as well.
    You can view the active open source projects from Microsoft 
    <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Until next time</h3>

<p>
    I will try my best to help push forward our craft, 
    and I think that the .NET community has a lot to offer.
