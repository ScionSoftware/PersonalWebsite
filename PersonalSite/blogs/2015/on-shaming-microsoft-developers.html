    When did shaming developers for the technology they work in become okay?
</p>

<p>
    I get the whole camaraderie thing, 
    poking fun at each other for your inferior technology choices.
    I am talking about exclusion and rude comments based on career choices.
</p>

<p>
    I am speaking from the view of a professional .NET stack developer. 
    I feel as though I have been lucky enough to have friends who are 
    very involved in development and technologies way off 
    the typical commercial .NET developer radar.
</p>

<p>
    There is this old stigma that has followed all Microsoft 
    technologies from the neckbeards in the open source think tanks back in the day. 
    This boils down to Microsoft being an evil corporation 
    who is an enemy to the progress of software, 
    because of their original views on intellectual property. 
    They did not share for free and so were shunned 
    by the talking heads of the software community.
</p>

<p>
    I have a very vivid memory from my first conference ever. 
    I went to a MongoDB conference in New York City. 
    I was fresh out of college and very excited to see 
    what this conference had to offer. 
    My friend and I were chatting up a very experienced java consultant
    and he asked us what we do. 
    My friend told him about his latest PHP projects, 
    and I mentioned that I was an intern doing VB.NET work. 
    He then proceeded to turn his shoulder to me and chat with my friend, 
    effectively closing me out of the conversation.
</p>

<h3>Don't shut people out, include them</h3>

<p>
    The fact that this is my most vivid memory from my first conference ever certainly says something. 
    What kind of jerk would literally shut out a 
    bright-eyed and bushy-tailed junior developer from the entire conversation, 
    simply based on the technology they happen to work with?
</p>

<p>
    I totally get the old vendetta thing. 
    I get that this is a decades old religious war 
    between open source and proprietary ideologies, 
    but don't treat some new kid as scum the moment 
    they mention they use a technology from the 
    corporate overlords you love to hate.
</p>

<p>
    That kid has no idea what the open source movement really means yet, 
    and why you believe proprietary software is bad for the world. 
    Even if they did know that, it's okay to not share your beliefs. 
</p>

<h3>We don't usually see the problem</h3>

<p>
    I really don't know how aware the majority of .NET developers 
    are of the complete distaste the a lot of the industry has. 
    I try to make it a point to go to non .NET conferences 
    and meetups to stay aware of the industry in an agnostic sense, 
    and I also feel that most Microsoft conferences are sales pitches 
    and for patting us on our backs to tell us how awesome we are.
</p>

<p>
    Going back to having vivid memories of conferences, 
    you almost know when you're talking to a .NET developer 
    at one of these agnostic events, because they are very reluctant 
    to tell you what technology stack they work in. 
    I usually respond by immediately telling them mine.
</p>

<h3>Bias makes you blind</h3>

<p>
    I was sitting in on an awsome presentation about the next version of JavaScript, 
    slated for 2016, and the best comment the girl sitting next to me could come 
    up with while we were chatting was, "This guy is from Microsoft? Why is he here?".
</p>

<p>
    Really? Really? This guy is on the team determining the future of JavaScript, 
    and you just can't get past the fact that he works for Microsoft? 
    I told her I was a C# developer at that point; 
    she laughed it off, and avoided further discussion about it.
</p>

<h3>Microsoft is turning it around</h3>

<p>
    I think if I really asked these people why they hate Microsoft so much, 
    most of them would struggle to come up with a decent answer. 
    They would at least have to think hard about it before they 
    remembered what their neckbeard forefathers preached in the 1990s.
</p>

<p>
    The funny part about all of this, is that .NET Core is now open source. 
    This stack's ecosystem is actually incredibly rich, 
    which is why many developers never actually venture outside of it. 
    Microsoft has wisened up though, 
    knowing that the best way to expand its developer base, 
    is to play to our passions. 
    A lot of Microsoft developers are starting to get more 
    adventurous as the internet becomes a more effective sharing community.
</p>

<h3>Final statements</h3>

<p>
    Don't disregard other developers based on their technology stack or career choices.
    I want to finish this with a broader message though.
    Don't shame anyone about their choices in any aspect of life, because it's not your life. 
    Just respect it.
</p>
