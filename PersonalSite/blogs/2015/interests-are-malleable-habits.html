    I recently had a conversation that started with finding the time to 
    sharpen and polish our skillsets. This conversation branched out into
    finding time to relax and naturally into being happy and feeling fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
    We digressed into how it very often feels unnatural and even painful to 
    do things that we aren't good at or that we don't find immediate gratification in.
</p>

<p>
    It is very easy to fall back into doing the easy things like watching your 
    favorite shows in Dorito and ice cream stained t-shirts. 
    It's incredibly difficult to run 3 miles everyday or 
    code a bit everyday or release a blog post every week. 
    Maintaining these habits over the long term can so easily be cut short by sloth.
</p>

<p>
    I believe that if you push yourself to maintain those 
    habits which are beneficial to your life, they will eventually become your interests.
    If you push yourself to maintain these great habits, 
    you will either learn to enjoy them (as one enjoys coffee) 
    or you won't feel right if you break your habit (as one relies on coffee).

    I am currently reading a book titled "The Richest Man in Babylon".
    The book is about Arkad (the richest man in babylon) passing lessons onto 100 other men 
    so that they may also find financial independence. Arkad calls 
    these lessons the seven cures for a lean wallet.
</p>

<h4>
    The second of the seven cures is this: "Control thy expenditures"
</h4>

<blockquote>
    Some of your members, my students have asked me this: 
    How can a man keep one-tenth of all he earns in his 
    purse when all the coins he earns are not enough 
    for his necessary expenses?
    <br />
    ...
    <br />
    Now I will tell thee an unusual truth about men and sons of men. 
    It is this; That what each of us calls our 'necessary expenses' 
    will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest the contrary.
    Confuse not the necessary expenses with thy desires.
    <br />
    ...
    <br />
    Study thoughtfully thy accustomed habits of living. 
    Herein may be most often found certain accepted expenses 
    that may wisely be reduced or eliminated.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Arkad goes on to explain the merits of budgeting efficiently 
    and how doing so will enable us to later gratify the less 
    superfluous and fleeting desires of our life.
</p>

<h4>
    Time: A fixed income
</h4>

<p>
    If we can make the jump from budgeting our income to budgeting our time,
    we can see that we're all on a fixed income per day. 
    We have 24 hours each day and 168 hours every week to live our life accordingly.
</p>

<p>
    Our decisions snowball over time like compounding interest in an investment.
</p>

<h4>
    Budget according to what fulfills you
</h4>

<p>
    I have found that I have never felt good about me after being lazy. 
    I have never found that I was happy or fulfilled after surfing facebook 
    or imgur for hours. 
</p>

<p>I <i>have</i> found fulfillment and happiness in these things: </p>

<ul class="styled">
    <li>Quality time with family</li>
    <li>Proper sleep</li>
    <li>Plenty of exercise</li>
    <li>Fixing my house</li>
    <li>Learning new and profitable skills</li>
    <li>Solving challenging problems</li>
    <li>Enabling others to be successful</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is not nearly an exhaustive list but it illustrates that the passing desire to 
    be lazy and unproductive does not hold up. 
    I strive to eliminate those fleeting desires that impinge
    upon my ability to do what actually matters. 
</p>

<h4>Build your castle one brick at a time</h4>

<p>
    Our lives slip away the same way that projects do: One day at a time. 
    We sacrifice all of these small moments 
    for distractions and our ultimate goals slip away. 
    One day you might wake up and find that you need 
    to pull all nighters to get it back on track. 
    You can choose to do your dishes as you make them 
    or you can scramble to get them done after they have become a problem.
