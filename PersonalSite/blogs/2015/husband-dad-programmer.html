    Being a husband, a dad and a programmer is a good mix of fulfilling and demanding.
</p>

<p>
    It has been a constant balancing act for me.
</p>

<p>
    I make coffee and breakfast while hanging out with our 
    baby and try to sneak my wife an extra nap in the morning because 
    she tries to sneak me a full night's sleep during the workweek.
</p>

<p>
    I sneak read technology news feeds and Twitter 
    before I give our baby a bath every night.
</p>

<p>
    I write while I sit in the nursery stroking our baby's 
    forehead to help her down to sleep for the night.
</p>

<p>
    I will say that working remotely has been one of the best decisions I have made. 
    I need all of the time I can get.
</p>

<p>
    I get to stick around a lot longer in the morning.
    I get to sneak out of my office and say hi to my wife and kid throughout the day. 
    I get to steal kisses and I don't need to miss any big developments or milestones.
</p>

<p>
    If I am on call or fielding any issues or behind on a deadline, 
    it isn't as bad because I am still here.
</p>

<p>
    Even with this flexibility, 
    I feel a lot of pressure to really push my boundaries and abilities. 
    I need to constantly think about whether I am using my time wisely.
    I definitely struggle to optimize my time every single day 
    in a field where being relevant means always learning.
</p>

<p>
    Even when I'm not working, 
    I am often thinking about work and what I could be doing better. 
    I think about what I should be learning and writing about. 
    I think about how I should be networking better and getting out of the house.
</p>

<p>
    I have always wished that I could just eliminate sleep entirely. 
    It feels like I could do so much more if I could but seeing as I can't, 
    it's very important to get proper sleep every night so that 
    I have the patience for this stuff every day.
</p>

<p>
    It is difficult to justify time for much of anything outside 
    of work and family time with a young baby, 
    but it is also important to not allow exercise 
    and fitness to fall to the wayside. 
    I bought a bike desk to get my cardio in during the work day. 
    I try not to pedal much during meetings because 
    I wouldn't want to distract people with heavy breathing.
</p>

<p>
    Sleep and exercise are incredibly important for maintaining 
    the good condition of your body and brain, 
    which I really need for all three of the roles I play.
</p>

<p>
    Something that has been great for me lately 
    is to take a day per week where I try to 
    shun programming and professional development from my mind. 
    It is incredibly recharging and lets me focus purely on 
    family and to return somewhat refreshed from the previous week. 
    I don’t always get this day in but I am finding it 
    increasingly important to avoid burnout.
</p>

<p>
    I hope that I can continue to find ways to optimize my life for 
    the things that make me truly happy. 
    I hope that I can continue to rise in all three of my roles. 
    I want to be a little bit better at being a 
    husband-dad-programmer every day.
