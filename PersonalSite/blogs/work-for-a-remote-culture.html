<p>
    Companies that support remote workers and do it well seem to have a huge leg up on the competition.
</p>

<h4>They prioritize communication and collaboration by necessity </h4>
<p>
    They reach out to include all parties in meetings and events.
    The organizational structure is inherently built to be inclusive
    because you couldn't get work done effectively otherwise.
    In an on-site environment there is so much verbal communication,
    that it wouldn't be feasible to share it with all relevant parties.
    In a remote culture your "hallway conversations" are saved in your messengers, 
    so you can easily pull out the essence of your conversations. 
    Facilitating this information sharing in a remote culture 
    can create a lot of white noise in email and meetings, so 
    organizational structures like the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System" target="_blank">Incident Command System</a>
    tend to arise naturally.
    I would say that on-site workers benefit from this more efficient communication structure too.
</p>

<h4>It is easy to reach out for help </h4>
<p>
    It is easy to reach out to anyone because all it takes is a non-intrusive email or message,
    which you can follow up on several times without being as blatant as barging into some
    office or cubicle, just to have a chat. Then there is an inherent reminder list for
    each of us to get back to people who have reached out to us.
    You can also think a bit more on how you want to ask for help,
    so that you don't sound like a fool.
</p>

<h4>There is a lot less wasted communication </h4>
<p>
    We tend to think more about what we say when we need to take the time to type it up.
    What we do communicate is automatically documented and can be referred to directly,
    instead of playing telephone with the original message. Even if we are over-communicating, it is okay,
    because we aren't forcing a squadron of employees to sit in a meeting room pretending to be interested.
    If you're only partially needed or interested in some meeting, you can attend, but still get work done.
</p>

<h4>There is a lot less posturing </h4>
<p>
    The lack of posturing is something very refreshing.
    I have to believe that it has something to do with the fact
    that most of the effective communication is either written,
    or is done in large meetings where lots of people are watching.
    Whatever the reason is, most of the communication is
    about sharing knowledge and hashing out problems 
    and not just personal advancement.
    Because we can't rely on body language and subtle dominance tactics,
    we need to present our ideas with logic and favor for the common good.
</p>

<h4>There is often a higher caliber of workers </h4>
<p>
    This is another point that I can't fully explain, but I would say that because there is no
    geographical limitation, you get to pick the cream of the crop from anywhere in the world.
    I would say that it takes an especially focused and driven individual to succeed in a remote environment,
    so filtering out the fluff is a necessity.
    You need to be organized and you can't hide behind meetings and the work other people do as easily.
    There is a pressure to be on, because you want to be sure you're known as a hard worker.
    There is this stigma with remote workers, where everyone talks about how easy it is to slack off,
    which really just means that the onus is on us to disprove that.
    It also means that I can work my butt off, but didn't really need to put pants on in the morning to do so.
    I wear pants though, that was just an example.
</p>

<h4>You get a huge portion of your life back </h4>
<p>
    Say goodbye to commuting and gas costs and rush hour
    and car maintenance costs and the time consuming morning routines.
    Time is money and not needing to commute is a seriously helpful perk.
    The company is rewarded with you being happier 
    and likely gets another half hour to an hour of real work out of you.
</p>
<p>
    I mean, some people spend HOURS commuting every single day.
    If you spend an hour a day commuting,
    that is 250 hours a year you've lost to the asphalt rivers of doom (1 * 5 * 50).
    You could also hear that as more than <i>6 forty hour work weeks</i>.
    <br /> <br />
    Here is the average one way commute time for someone in the US:

<h4>They tend to be more flexible in general </h4>
<p>
    Any company who is flexible enough to do a good job at supporting remote workers 
    is likely a company that respects that life happens and people may have shifting schedules.
    My experience has been that I have been able to be a lot more productive
    and less stressed in the rest of my life due to working for a good remote organization.
</p>

<h4>Chicken or the egg problems</h4>
<p>
    The mystery to me here is whether striving to have a great remote culture encouraged
    the organization to be excellent, or whether the organization had to be excellent in the
    first place to create a successful remote culture. Either way, it seems that good remote
    companies tend to be far above average as far as effective companies go.
</p>

<p>
    I don't think I'd be satisfied working for a company
    that didn't make remote workers a priority.
    They just seem to have the other priorities straight as well.
    If you get the opportunity to work for an
    organization that promotes a remote culture,
    I highly suggest giving it a try.
