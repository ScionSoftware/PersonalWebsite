<p>Jargon sucks sometimes, and it’s just another barrier to entry. 
    This is the beginning of a series of short and sweet explanations of concepts in programming.</p>

<p>I figured, seeing as it is something I have battled as a young developer 
    coming out of a curriculum weak in theory, that I would put together a 
    list of relevant and often used terms and acronyms. 
    I will try to cater to people with a very minimal frame of reference for these terms.</p>

<p>I hope this can help some new folk up to speed.</p>

<h4>Jimmy</h4>
<p>A newb developer. Also can refer to one’s “cool”. 
    Don’t get your jimmies rustled. 
    Jimmy is over there rustling some code again, someone help him out.</p>

<h4>Collection</h4>
<p>A collection is just an organization of like objects. You may also hear terms like array, list, set and more.</p>

<h4>Node</h4>
<p>For most intents and purposes, node means item. 
    A node can be an item in something like a collection or tree or graph.</p>

<h4>Enumerate or enumeration</h4>
<p>This means to move through a collection of objects one by one. (node by node)</p>

<h4>Hash</h4>
<p>When you hash an object, you take all of it’s properties, 
    and use a hashing algorithm to get a key unique to objects with those values. 
    This is often useful in creating dictionaries or hash maps, another type of collection.</p>

<h4>Class</h4>
<p>A class is simply an organization of code with access modifiers.
    It is pretty much the core facet of object oriented programming. 
    Classes can contain properties and methods.</p>

<h4>Property</h4>
<p>A property is an attribute on an object. 
    It is usually an intermediary which you use to get or manipulate some data.</p>

<h4>Method</h4>
<p>A method is basically a named chunk of code. 
    It is a consolidated and reusable way to perform some logic. 
    Methods can accept parameters to assist in performing logic, 
    and methods can return values. Methods are simply functions 
    within classes.</p>

<h4>Interface</h4>
<p>
    An interface can be considered as a contract. 
    You specify a contract that some class has to abide by.
    This contract is usually of what methods or properties a class must have.
    A class that implements an interface must have every method and property defined in the interface.
    Interfaces are awesome because they allow us to abstract away the implementation of something
    from the users of our code. 
    For example, you use a switch to turn on a light, 
    you don't care how the light turns on, only that it does.
</p>

<h4>Obfuscation</h4>
<p>This is when you want to conceal purpose, prevent modification, or don't want something to be modified. 
    In programming this is usually through encryption or masking. 
    Think of passwords, you don't want people to see those.</p>

<h4>Encapsulation</h4>
<p>To encapsulate is to enclose logic away from users of an object. 
    You define the interfaces you want to be used, and you hide away the logic via private calls to whatever you want. 
    Encapsulation is a very very important aspect of clean programming.</p>

<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<p>A process or set of rules to be followed. 
    Often used when talking about code to process a collection of objects.</p>

<h4>Abstraction</h4>
<p>Basically, making things more human understandable (hopefully). 
    You typically want to hide the details in your implementations.</p>

<h4>Query</h4>
<p>This is what it sounds like. 
    You ask a data source a question and you receive the data or answer.</p>

<h4>Serialization</h4>
<p>This is an oft used term that boils down to, turn an object into some other format. 
    This is usually for transport or storage.

    </a></p>
<h4>Parse or parsing</h4>
<p>Read text or strings and process them into useful data structures 
    (e.g., an object of one of the classes you or someone else has defined).</p>

<h4>API (Application Programming Interface)</h4>
<p>This is basically a specification of how programs interact with each other. 
    It is a set of outward facing methods that obscure a lot of inner workings. 
    This is generically and generally, a facade pattern.</p>

<p style="border:aquamarine medium solid; padding: 4px;">If you have any questions about any of my definitions, 
    or have any corrections, let me know and I’ll gladly assist. 
    I’ll try to release general definitions of jargon on a regular basis, 
    and maybe run through some of the code I have been writing lately.</p>
