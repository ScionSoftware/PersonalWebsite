<p>
    This week I'd like to announce that I officially own Scion Software, LLC. 
    I am going to start working with Particular Software in September. 
    Particular is based in Israel, and only hires people full time if they live there, 
    so you need to be associated with some business entity for payment otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    I've always known that I was going to start my own business, 
    but I never thought it would be this soon. 
    I tend to procrastinate on big decisions like this 
    if there is nothing to force my hand, 
    so I am always sort of happy when something comes up that does.
</p>

<p>
    For some context, I knew for a while that I wanted to marry my wife, 
    but I also knew that I would end up putting off asking her because 
    there would always be something else to do or think about first, 
    so I wrote a proposal note and packed it away in a goblet she bought me. 
    I knew that when we unpacked that, 
    we would have been moved in and living together. 
    Then came the day and then came my proposal.
</p>

<p>
    I know that I sometimes need an extra push.
</p>

<p>
    I knew that I wanted to work with open source software for .NET, 
    and Particular gives me that opportunity. 
    Particular will help me to not only hone my abilities in technology, 
    but also to help other people do so at a larger scale. 
    It should also give my soft skills a big kick in the pants too.
</p>

<p>
    I hope to bring these same values to my business as well. 
    It will be open source by default and will prioritize 
    flexibility and pragmatism over business as usual.
</p>

<p>
    It is very exciting to get to work on difficult problems 
    with such an awesome organization and people. 
    I am confident that this will be an awesome learning experience, 
    and I hope to bring them a ton of value too.
</p>

<p>
    I am in the process of putting together a website for Scion Software 
    and that will be where my blog is from now on, 
    as I don't feel like maintaining two blogs.
    You can see what Particular Software is all about 
    <a href="http://particular.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    You can see all of their source code 
    <a href="https://github.com/particular" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I'd love to hear about any experiences you have 
    in open source and starting your own business.

    If you feel like it, drop me a line.
