    Turnover is a great thing. 
    It is good for your company to have employees leave.
</p>

<p>
    Sandro Mancuso, (author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/socra" target="_blank">The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride</a>)
    states that somewhere between 15% and 30% for employee turnover is the sweet spot.
</p>

<p>
    Those sound like a huge numbers and are probably 
    terrifying to most stable development shops. This definitely isn't for everyone.
</p>

<p>
    I see a particular pattern when passionate people start a new job. 
    They want to get up to speed with all of the good things going on at their new job as quickly as they can, and they want to show their new co-workers how much they have to offer.
</p>

<p>
    These people are the honeymooners. 
    They just started their relationship with a company and want to do what they can to make their honey happy.
</p>

<p>
    I'd say this phase lasts for somewhere between six months to a couple years in most instances. 
    This length of time is also when the most value is exchanged between employer and employee. 
    The bulk of the employee best practices are disseminated as quickly as they can muster, 
    and they are inherently picking up all the new skills needed to do the job.
</p>

<p>
    After the honeymoon, they have shared the best parts of their knowledge gained over the years, 
    and have settled into the job, only picking up new things as they haphazardly present themselves.
</p>

<p>
    Personal progress and organizational improvement start to have a downward trend for this particular employee.
</p>

<p>
    Now remember, this is a picture of a particular employee, not every employee. 
    If this employee, and every other employee decides to stay right where they are, 
    people are apt to get complacent. 
    You often need those whirlwind honeymooners to come in and shake things up.
</p>

<p>
    People with passion tend to have their own ambitions. 
    They are enterprising self starters. 
    They are often entrepreneurs. 
    You typically want to work with these types of people because they have fire, 
    and they use that fire to get other people motivated again.
</p>

<p>
    It is a very awkward dance that the employers and employed perform while they are with each other. 
    We very facetiously operate under the notion that we'll be with each other forever. 
    We're soul mates and we'll never find anyone better.
</p>

<p>
    Thinking or acting like that is counter productive. 
    I went to a talk at QCon by Erran Berger of LinkedIn and he said that whenever he onboards a new employee, he has the talk. 
    He tells them, I know that you're probably going to leave us someday, 
    I just want to make sure that we have the most productive relationship while you are here so that we can help you want to be here.
    He then follows up with them continuously, ensuring that both sides are heard, and expectations are being met.
    This way, you know that when someone is leaving, it's not because they are a spiteful honey, it's because it is a better situation for them to do so.
</p>

<p>
    THAT is productive. It stares turnover in the face and says, BE MY HONEY.
</p>

<p>
    With all of this talk about honeymooners and whirlwinders, I do not mean to say that <i>all</i> turnover is a good thing.
    Turnover is good when you expect it and it doesn't leave you in a successively worse spot.

<p>
    Speaking to the good parts of turnover, you CAN keep very good programmers for a very long time.
    Passionate people want to contribute and grow with other people who want to do the same. 
    Businesses such as consulting and contracting are optimized for programmers 
    to pick up new skills and constantly work with new people,
    but how would everyone else hold a candle to that?

    If you can establish a good cultural core of passionate developers, 
    then you can focus on establishing and keeping a pipeline of awesome candidates.
    If your hiring process is such that you put a focus on bringing in passionate people, 
    and you have a good core of passionate and experienced developers, 
    losing any certain employee should not be that big of a deal. 
    In fact, losing employees should be a good check on your system, 
    ensuring that you don't have too many eggs in one basket. 
    The new people that you bring in will be sure to bring their good practices and ideas with them, 
    which will be fresh for your core members, which will in turn scratch their itch.
    These new people will hopefully also be pointing out when you're

    If they aren't pointing out flaws, make sure to solicit negative feedback, as it can be hard to give.

<p>
    If we embrace turnover as a chummy friend, 
    we can leverage it to grow and innovate at a much faster rate than those places that pretend it doesn't exist.
    We can also make sure that our best stay with us even longer, 
    because we are constantly evaluating what makes staying a valuable proposition for them.
