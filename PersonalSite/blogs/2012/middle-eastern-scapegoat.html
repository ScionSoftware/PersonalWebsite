<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
    The 2010 United States military budget was a 636.6-billion-dollar package. (14) The actual spending jumped the approved budget by over $200-billion. The total spending for military purposes is an estimated $871.9-billion, for the fiscal year 2010. This statistic includes “emergency spending” and discretionary portions of the Federal budget.  (13) According to the Stockholm International Peace research Institute, the United States military expenditure in 2010 was greater than the next twenty countries in the military expenditure list combined. This number seems very substantial, especially when compared with other delegations of the total US budget.

<p>
    From the dawn of the new millennium, United States budgeted military spending has far surpassed 6-trillion U.S. dollars. This statistic is determined from figures given by the Office of Management and Budget. (16) The figure there does not include much of the rebuilding and discretionary aid given from the discretionary budget of the United States Congress. Many “Off-Budget” estimates push the defense spending to above $1.3 Trillion for the fiscal year of 2010. This number does not include the money that is to be delegated to the after math of the wars including: rebuilding of Iraq and Afghanistan, veteran retirement, and disability of soldiers. One of the main points in question is whether military facets merit more of the budget than domestic areas, such as education and infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    Before we can understand how great a problem all of this military spending is, we must first know what could be construed as the core cause. A Military-industrial complex (MIC) consists of a country’s military establishment and those industries producing arms or other military materials. (12) The Military-industrial complex may be, more accurately described as the Military-industrial-congressional complex (MICC). It is a concept often used to refer to the policy and monetary relationships between legislators, the armed forces, and the industrial sectors that support them. (12)
</p>
<h2>Specific Instances and Focus</h2>
<p>
    To narrow the scope of the problem to a more specific case, the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan total almost $1.3 trillion according to the National Priorities Project. (15) There are many facets of military spending in each of these wars described as completely frivolous. Spending on warfare technology, by some standards, might be more productively redirected into peaceful innovation or even invention. Much of the United States failing educational system or infrastructure could be revitalized. With the sort of capital and resources thrown into warfare, our infrastructure could possibly be revamped entirely. By reviewing some individual instances of spending, other options for these resources may become more apparent.
</p>
<p>
    An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is an aircraft with no pilot on-board. They can be remote controlled or flown based on a pre-programmed plan. These units range from a few million dollars to over $20 million. (11) One such example of an aircraft is the Predator Drone. The RQ-1 Predator Unmanned Aircraft is an armed plane, operated by remote control. This particular type costs $20 million per unit. Many media outlets were stating that these drones would turn out to be Osama Bin Laden’s worst nightmare, when in fact they seemed to be more of a drain on United States funding.  According to a few leaked sources, since 1995, an estimated 17 of the 50 Predator drones built for the Air Force have crashed during testing. Another five drones are believed to have been shot down on military missions. At $20 million per predator, hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost during testing alone. (11) The capital from these lost units could generously fund an alternative energy program. This would be enough to build over one hundred new windmills with the potential to power 2,000 homes each. (10) That construction would lead to clean and cheap surplus energy for over 20,000 homes.
</p>
<p>
    Predator drones come equipped with Hellfire missiles.  The cost of a single AGM-114 Hellfire missile is approximately $40,000 (4), approximately the same as the average per person personal income per year in the United States. This missile equips several aircraft used by the Marines as well. (18) From 2001 to 2007, the United States has launched thousands of hellfire missiles in combat. Each of these missiles took money that could have taken care of all the needs of a family of four for a full year.
</p>
<p>
    In 2006, the U.S.S. Reagan, a $5.4 billion aircraft carrier was put into operation. This is in addition to the 12 that were already in operation. Each carrier has accompanying convoys and very large operational costs. This brings the total initial cost of the U.S.S. Reagan to over $8 billion, a cash amount that could generously fund every single community college in New York State for at least 3 years. (17) This new carrier seems untimely, a huge criticism being that the United States rule virtually unchallenged on the high seas.
</p>
<p>
    The Tomahawk missile is a long range, subsonic cruise missile used for land stack warfare. These missiles are typically launched from ships and submarines. Each individual unit costs approximately $1.41 million. The opening attacks on Afghanistan used up about 50 Tomahawks. This dropped $70 million in one fell swoop. In the recent missile bombardment of Libya, the United States and the United Kingdom launched a barrage of at least 161 Tomahawk missiles to flatten out Moammar Ghaddafi’s defenses. If this is taken with a fiscal perspective, in a time where United States Congress is fighting over every last dollar, this show of military might could have possibly been spared. In just a few hours, almost $230 million worth of military technology was sent into Libya, resulting in ruin.
</p>
<p>
    The EA-6B Electronic Warfare Aircraft, also known as the “Prowler”, is an electronic warfare plane which jams enemy radar, and electronic data links and communications. It has been developed and sold by the Northrop Grumman Aerospace Corporation and costs approximately $52 million per unit. (3) It has been used to broadcast to the Afghani and Iraqi people, as well as an anti-improvised explosive device. This is an example of, in my opinion, an acceptable expenditure of defense spending if only for the additional safety it would provide to our troops. There are approximately 125 Prowlers remaining and each division of the military uses them for various missions, air support, and communication. However, we still must denote the fact that a single one of these planes is worth at least $52 million. (2) Each plane in operation, not including service and maintenance, totals to $6.5 billion.
</p>
<p>
    The A-10/OA-10 Thunderbolt II, or “Warthog”, is essentially a combative cargo plane. It can carry 16,000 pounds of resources and fire rounds at a rate of up to 4,100 per minute. (1) Fairchild Republic Company sells these units at approximately $8.8 million per plane. This is an example of one of the most cost effective units that the United States military employs, and yet the cost is still very high. The government plans to maintain these as serviceable planes until 2040. The service plan through 2013 is projected to cost $2.3 billion. (9) This should give a frame of reference as to how expensive even the most cost effective units in the military are. The idea that a set of planes merits more resources than most colleges is baffling.
</p>
<p>
    Many of the sections of the United States budget are neglected because of the extensive and obsessive spending within the Department of Defense. The infrastructure in the United States is vital to the economy. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, America’s overall infrastructure is graded at a ‘D+’, with a ‘C’ being ‘Fair’. In the Journal of Mechanical Engineering, Steven Ashley states, “Most engineers and construction industry experts agree that the United States infrastructure is in bad shape, particularly the country’s vast complement of highway bridges.” This is particularly surprising because the United States Congress continues to spend over half of the discretionary budget on military applications.  (7)
</p>
<p>
    The 2001 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure lays out the core problems and needed investments in many components of our country. Road conditions account for thousands of fatalities every year. Many bridges are considered structurally deficient or obsolete. Schools no longer meet the needs of the student and the estimated investment need to bring them up to par was $127 million in 2001. The grades have most definitely not improved since then. The 2009 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure gives America a grade point average of ‘D’. The numbers call for an investment of $2.2 trillion over a five-year period. Any significant fraction of this number could greatly improve our living standards, and give the economy a huge boost. Over the last 10 years, we have succeeded in allowing our infrastructure and reputation to deteriorate further. (7)
</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Question the Methods</h2>
<p>
    An article published by CBS news in 2009 cites Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declaring war on the Pentagon bureaucracy. (7)  Rumsfeld stated, “According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.” This shows that not even the advertised spending of our agencies is necessarily accurate. $2.3 trillion is by no means a sum that should simply disappear without explanation. Government agencies are plagued by this lack of transparency.
</p>
<p>
    Truly, a government has nothing to fear if they are serving the best interests of the people. Whether this spending is a result of a long-term accident of bureaucracy, or an engineered means of profit for the few, policy should change. Considering the deficit we face, there are more productive ways to use this capital. Unscrupulous military seems to be an issue only recently visited by our politicians and still with complete care. This may be an issue both parties can agree on: Stop spending wastefully, or go broke.
