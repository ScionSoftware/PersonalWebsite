<p>It is your duty to automate. </p>

<p>It is your duty to get rid of menial and repetitive manual tasks.</p>

<p>Why? Because they are an incredible waste of time, and you have the ability to remove them.</p>

<p>
    Think about it though, as engineers or whatever we call ourselves, we go on about how interruptions literally destroy our productivity.
    It goes up in smoke. It takes a fair bit of time for us to get back to wrestling the dragons in code.
    We have industry wide movements to reduce meetings to as few and short as possible.
    We outsource as much as we can that isn't coding to everyone else.
</p>

<p>
    Even with all that, there are necessary evils in our line of work.
    We need to... wait for it... test our code to make sure it works before we send it off.
    Sometimes this involves testing HTTP calls, sometimes it's just verifying a database report pulls back what we expect,
    sometimes it's verifying the console app doesn't bomb out.
    I would say though, that the most time consuming testing is pixel pushing.
    When you need to walk through an entire user experience just to test that golden pot at the end of the rainbow.
</p>

<p>
    The worst is when you have a stateful application,
    with a ton of setup that you as a developer need to run through every time you want to verify
    that some tiny change does what you expect in the bowels of your UI.
</p>

<p>
    This especially stands out when you think of productivity lost in teams.
    If you have ten developers, and this setup takes maybe an hour to get through on average,
    and your developers have to do it even once a week, you're losing a lot of horsepower over the course of a year.
</p>

<p>
    Barring 2 weeks for vacation
    <br/>
    10 Developers * 1 Hr * 50 Wks = <b>500 Hrs</b>
</p>

<p>
    Okay, 500 hours of work lost across ten developers, or 50 hours per person, or 12.5 man weeks.
    However you put it, that is a massive waste of productive time.
</p>

<p>
    Now think about all of the manual testing, the regression testing, and the bugs that sneak through anyways.
    You are retesting the same things over and over, with less and less rigour each time.
    You're not only wasting you and your teams time,
    you are doing the business you are working for an injustice because you could just as easily write some code to do it for you,
    and that code would test it better and for a longer time than you ever would.
    Write automaton for posterity!
    Your code will last a lot longer than you expect, and your tests will tell future generations what you intended.
</p>

<p>
    If you're someone calling the shots, treating visitation of technical debt and automation as some waste of time is a big and consistent mistake.
    Believe me, leaving this debt unpaid will cost you and your team a lot of time and money, and you will not end up with the best developers.
    If you're a developer, and you are not following the boy scout rule,
    and automating the manual things you and your team do over and over and over again,
    you are wasting your time and theirs.
    You are not being professional.
</p>

<p>
    I posit that a team that does not have test suites that will run through the vast majority of their system, either do not know better,
    or they are okay with being time vampires. This has exceptions, like every other generalization.
    Proof of concepts, marketing campaigns with an expiration date, and personal projects are a few of those exceptions.
    If you have a code base that is planned to be used for the foreseeable future, just write some automation.
</p>

<p>
    If you're "moving too fast to write tests", you are probably doing it wrong.
    You're saying, I'm completely okay with throwing out all my hard work and starting over again.
    You're saying, I am willing to spend even more time later picking up humpty dumpty again.
    Have you ever heard about the stanford marshmallow study?
</p>

<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment">Stanford Marshmallow Study</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a series of studies on delayed gratification in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by psychologist Walter Mischel, then a professor at Stanford University.
    In these studies, a child was offered a choice between one small reward provided immediately or two small rewards if they waited for a short period,
    approximately 15 minutes, during which the tester left the room and then returned. (The reward was sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel.)
    In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes,
    as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and other life measures.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Does any of the above sound like a decent metaphor to you?
    <br />
    I know I have been there, and sometimes I still take the marshmallow.
</p>

<p>
    Are you sick of working on systems with tons of technical debt?
    Are you sick of "needing" to rewrite those systems from the ground up?
    Are you sick of manually testing all of your changes?
    Well start changing that now. 
    Write automation, and save yourself the time and frustration so that you can work on the good stuff.
