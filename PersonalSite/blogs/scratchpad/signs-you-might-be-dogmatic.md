Gauging what you're worth is a very tricky practice. 

If you were to take two developers of seemingly similar value to a company, they may be paid wildly different salaries.
One might be making 100k, and the other might be making 60k. 

It is quite difficult to know what a company is willing to pay you if you don't know what similarly skilled developers are paid.
You're wandering in the dark at that point.

I'd say the most tricky aspect is that disclosing your salary is seen as taboo.

It's about status. It's about not betraying your organizations trust. 
It's about not hurting anybody's feelings or getting into trouble.
