<p>
	Software developers and engineers get bombarded with job opportunities.  
</p>

<p>
	These would be great, except we are usually happily employed.
	I've tried many times in the past to offer that I could work part time. 
	That I could augment their abilities and offer up good work for less overhead. 
</p>

<p>
	Many companies could benefit from augmenting their abilities with part time workers.
