<p>
    I talk to a lot of people who think up, use, or develop corporate/business niche applications.
    I am one of those people.
</p>
<p>
    Part of what we do, part of what we get paid to do, is to think.
    We get paid to learn the business model.
    We get paid to learn how to save money.
    Make processes better. Make lives easier.
</p>
<p>
    We learn by using, by reading, by applying our outside the box knowledge in new and creative ways.
    As they say in technology, if you’re not moving, you’re dying.
</p>
<p>
    When you have people in your organization who care.
    When you have people who want to perform, who want to shine,
    who want to fix things. Let them do their thing!
    If you are in a leadership position, and you have competent people,
    let them shine. Offer your business expertise,
    ask if they need anything from you,
    give them a direction, and stick with it until it's production ready.
</p>

<p>
    You have to manage so many expectations at once,
    how can you hope to properly analyze and prioritize
    grass root efforts to build up an awesome money maker
    in some subset of your giant corporation?
</p>
<p>
    People learning lasting lessons involve stumbling and kicking tires.
    Trust your professionals, and that respect and rapport you establish will far outweigh any micro-management.
</p>
<p>
    One of my biggest gripes in business life,
    particularly when it stops me from doing my job,
    is analysis paralysis.
</p>

<h3>Analysis Paralysis</h3>
<p>
    When you decide something is good to do, and research it and start the process,
    but the business side decides they should research where is best to put their money.
    Then you stop progress on the current task and research another task. Repeat cycle.
</p>
<p>
    You hired me to build on your property.
    You’re paying me to stumble out into your 20 acre backyard,
    eventually find the flag that signifies where I am supposed to dig,
    and by the time I find it, and start digging out the foundation for the garage you want,
    you decide that we should focus on an airplane hangar you wanted further back,
    because it will be a better investment of time, 
	and you really think you'll have more people show up to your party, because your one friend said they'd like to be able to bring their airplane. 
	This happens all the time.

<p>
    You paid us to dig out the foundation for a garage
    and then do nothing with the big hole.
    By the time we get back around to that hole,
    it will have been completely filled back in due to rain,
    and we'll have to start again, until you move us onto something else.
</p>
<p>
    You can't just always be thinking about the next sale.
	You need to finish features, fix problems, and retain the customers you gain.
</p>
<p>
    Let the work that is started go through.
    You’ll waste a lot less money.
    Listen to the people who are fervently trying to get better at what they do,
    and in turn make you more money.
