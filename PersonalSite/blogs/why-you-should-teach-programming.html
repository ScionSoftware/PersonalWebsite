<p>I love learning. I think most people who treat what they do as a craft love to learn. There is just something so satisfying about becoming a little bit better every single day.</p>

<p>If you have heard of the learning pyramid or the cone of learning, you know that teaching has a very high level of retention. 
    There are differing percentages and views on this pyramid, but the concept remains.</p>

<p>This is why I think every developer should teach and mentor. I think that my drive to teach and help has been one of the biggest contributing factors toward me knowing what the hell I am talking about. </p>

<p>Seriously, if you think you know something well, find someone who doesn't and try to teach them. My first few attempts at teaching were awful. I was terrible at it.</p>

<p>Someone who is just starting on a topic will ask you questions about things you either took for granted or had never even thought about. This left me scrambling many times for words to explain something I thought I knew.</p>

<p>This leads to the oft used Einstein quote.</p>

<blockquote>
    If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. - Albert Einstein
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't to say you shouldn't try to teach if you're not an expert. 
    I mean to say that teaching is the fastest way to expertise and mastery. 
    You may also find that the closer you are to someone's level, the more you gain out of teaching them.</p>

<p>A while back I had convinced my friend who used to be an English teacher to try this programming thing out. 
    He is insane, so he went for it. 
    Trying to guide someone into software development from scratch was one of the 
    most challenging teaching tasks I have ever taken on. 
    He has been putting in a lot of hard work and is now a full time associate software engineer.

<p>I had taught people various technologies and patterns and methodologies before, but nothing of this scale. I really had to grow into it and still have a long way to go.</p>

<p>You'll find that after you get some practice, you are able to organize your thoughts and words much better than before. You'll be aware of your knowledge gaps and you'll be a better communicator for it.</p>

<p>Teaching others has given me a huge advantage and I intend to do it as often as I can.</p>
