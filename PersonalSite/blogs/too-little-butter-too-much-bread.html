    I'm a bit of a Lord of the Rings fan, and I've been pondering life a bit over the past week.
    A particular quote popped into my head.
</p>

<blockquote>
    I feel... thin. Sort of stretched, like... butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday.
    -Bilbo Baggins

<p>I've been in panic mode to learn all I can, to accomplish as much as I can. There has been a noticeable change in my persona. I feel like a squirrel, sprinting to gather nuts with no perceivable plan. It probably looks that way too. Sorry to you, if you are a literary squirrel and happen to be reading this.</p>
<p>It seems that when no semblance of a plan can be seen, results are quite similar to the plan. I think that it's time to take a step back and look at what I have from a mile away.</p>

<p>So, this picture isn't completely relevant - but the point it illustrates for me, is that it's a miracle I got to where I am. No matter how I look at it, I am amazed. I've gotten here because of the relationships I have somehow cultivated over the years. Oh yay, another profound realization... but really! Slow down and focus on people damn it!</p>
<p>I think I know what will help. Stop trying to learn everything at once. Just pick one thing to become proficient in. If you're trying to pick up 80 limes and arrange them in the most efficient manner, it won't work and you'll just be pissed off.</p>

<p>So grab some friends, grab some family and see if they're interested in stacking those limes with you.  If they aren't? Stack them a one at a time and go play some <a href="http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/" title="Munchkin!" target="_blank">Munchkin</a> with them. It'll keep you grounded. I know I'd stop being productive if I was just a grump all the time. I'll close with another Bilbo quote.</p>
<blockquote>
    It's a dangerous business, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you might be swept off to.
    -Bilbo Baggins
