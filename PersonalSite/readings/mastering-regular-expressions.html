    <h4>Mastering Regular Expressions <sub>by Jeffrey Friedl</sub></h4>
    <p>
        Learning regular expressions was a quiet, but incredibly helpful undertaking. 
        This was another slow read, but well worth it. Being knowledgeable here saves 
        me at least a couple hours here and there in text editing, and is a boon to me 
        as far as getting grunt work done goes.
