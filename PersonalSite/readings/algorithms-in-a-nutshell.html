    <h4>Algorithms in a Nutshell 
        <sub>by George T. Heineman, Gary Pollice, & Stanley Selkow</sub>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Coming from a curriculum weak in theory, I felt I needed to really 
        step my game up. This is a bit of a slow read, but it also is a great 
        reference for the history of algorithms, and ones in common use. This is 
        where I gained my base in understanding algorithmic complexity.
