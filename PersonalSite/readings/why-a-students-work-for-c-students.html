    <h4>Why "A" Students Work for "C" Students <sub>by Robert Kiyosaki</sub></h4>
    <p>
        A provocative title, and an interesting view on the world. 
        Robert takes a very entreprenurial and responsibility based view on finances. 
        The idea is to free yourself from the chains of the rat race so 
        that you might pursue your pie in the sky ambitions, or simply enjoy your life. 
        The book details that our education system is not wired to encourage creativity 
        and leadership.
