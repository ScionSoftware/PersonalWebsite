    <h4>Javascript: The Good Parts <sub>by Douglas Crockford</sub></h4>
    <p>
        This book help made sense of the fears illicited by javscript 
        in the old development world. It also made sense of how to keep 
        your javascript standard and manageable in the wild west of web 
        development. This is not a book of code organization. It is a book 
        of what to avoid, and which idioms to stand by in this strange, 
        but awesome language.
