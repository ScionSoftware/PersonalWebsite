    <h4>The New Kingmakers <sub>by Stephen O'Grady</sub></h4>
    <p>
        How Developers Conquered the World. Another provocative title which 
        details how business has become so dependent on IT for not only 
        competitive advantage, but also daily operation. Developers have 
        leveraged this to increase influence and actively shape our technological 
        future. The open source movement is a tidal wave, and we'd do well to surf it.
