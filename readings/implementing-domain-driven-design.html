    <h4>Implementing Domain Driven Design <sub>by Vaughn Vernon</sub></h4>
    <p>
        I am currently in the process of reading this book.
        It seems to be just the medicine I need, as parable based lessons
        for introducing and effectively implementing domain-driven design. It starts fast with 
        terminology, so keep google handy.
