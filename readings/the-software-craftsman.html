    <h4>The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride <sub>by Sandro Mancuso</sub></h4>
    <p>
        This book is very much an autobiography of a software expert and pioneer in software craftsmanship.
        Sandro details his pragmatic views on methodologies, processes and people. 
        He dives into why projects and organizations are so incredibly mismanaged
        and how programmers have gone from factory workers to incredibly valuable professionals.
        The recurring theme in this book is of being a true professional.
        If you're in the software field, I highly recommend reading this book.
