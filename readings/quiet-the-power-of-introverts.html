    <h4>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking
        <sub>by Susan Cain</sub>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Quiet is a sort of sociological check on the types of personalities we value. 
        Susan Cain posits that the qualities associated with introverts
        tend to be under valued and misunderstood in America. 
        She pushes for introverts to find their strengths and 
        for balance in decision making between extroverts and introverts. 
        This book is valuable in knowing how to relate to introverts 
        as well as being more effective in relationships as an introvert.
