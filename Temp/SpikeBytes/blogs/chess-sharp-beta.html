<p>Hey everyone, haven't written in a while, but I write now with exciting news!</p>

<h5><a href="http://chesssharp.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Chess Sharp - Beta</a></h5>

<p>I have released my chess application. I am still working out a few kinks, but it has been a long time coming.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

    </a>
</div>
<p>It doesn't work on IE8, but feel free to try it out on your mobile phone and let me know how you feel about it.</p>

<p>
    About a year and a half ago, I intended to have it released in a couple months, but life got in the way I suppose.
    Feel free to check it out, and let me know if there are any really glaring bugs.
    I know of a couple already that pertain to the validation of checkmate...
    Hopefully I will have those fixed before you find them though.
</p>

<p>
    Don't become too attached to your record though, as this is only beta, I can not guaruntee the data will stick around,
    and I can also not guaruntee that it will stay at that URL for very long either.

<p>
    Currently I have a few projects kicking around. One of which is a rental applications for tenants and landlords.
    This rental application is probably going to be what I bore into next...
    So these updates to the chess application are probably going to wait for a while,
    at least until I get this rental application out in the wild. Goal is in the next two months.
