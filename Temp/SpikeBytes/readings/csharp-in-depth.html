    <h4>C# In Depth <sub>by Jon Skeet</sub></h4>
    <p>
        If you find yourself getting involved with C#, you'll end up
        finding a lot of entries on Stackoverflow from Jon Skeet. He is 
        one of the most influential and knowledgeable resources on this language.
        This book allowed me to pick up, or at the very least, have heard of, 
        many of the features in C# in a fraction of the time I should have.
